    <p>
        The origins of the American Revolution can be traced to a 
        combination of political, economic, and ideological factors 
        that developed over several decades. Tensions began to rise 
        in the aftermath of the French and Indian War (1754–1763), 
        as Britain sought to manage its massive war debt by taxing 
        its American colonies. Measures such as the Sugar Act (1764), 
        Stamp Act (1765), and Townshend Acts (1767) imposed new taxes 
        and regulations on the colonies, sparking widespread resentment. 
        Colonists objected to "taxation without representation," 
        arguing that they should not be taxed by a Parliament in which 
        they had no elected representatives.

        The British government further angered colonists by asserting its 
        authority through measures like the Quartering Act, which required 
        colonists to house British soldiers, and the Declaratory Act (1766), 
        affirming Parliament's right to legislate for the colonies "in all 
        cases whatsoever." Tensions escalated with the passage of the Tea Act (1773), 
        which led to the Boston Tea Party, a dramatic act of protest in which 
        colonists dumped British tea into Boston Harbor. Britain responded with 
        the Coercive Acts (1774), known to the colonists as the Intolerable Acts, 
        which included punitive measures such as closing Boston Harbor and 
        restricting colonial self-governance.

        These actions, combined with the growing influence of Enlightenment 
        ideas about liberty, natural rights, and the social contract, 
        galvanized resistance among the colonies. Groups like the Sons of 
        Liberty organized protests, while colonial leaders called for unity 
        and collective action. The First Continental Congress convened in 1774 
        to coordinate a response, leading to a colonial-wide boycott of British 
        goods. The breakdown in relations ultimately resulted in armed conflict 
        at Lexington and Concord in April 1775, marking the beginning of the 
        Revolutionary War. The origins of the Revolution thus lay in the complex 
        interplay of British policies, colonial grievances, and the colonies’ 
        evolving sense of identity and rights.

    <h2> Major Battles </h2>
    <p>The American Revolution featured several major battles that significantly 
        influenced its outcome. The Battle of Bunker Hill in June 1775, though a 
        British victory, demonstrated the determination of the colonial forces 
        and revealed that defeating the Americans would not be easy. In August 
        1776, the Battle of Long Island, the largest battle of the war, resulted 
        in a decisive British victory and forced General George Washington and the 
        Continental Army to retreat, highlighting British military strength early 
        in the conflict. A turning point came with the Battle of Saratoga in the 
        fall of 1777, where American forces defeated British General John Burgoyne’s 
        army. This victory convinced France to join the war as an ally, providing 
        essential military and financial support. In January 1781, the Battle of 
        Cowpens in the Southern Campaign showcased brilliant American strategy, 
        as General Daniel Morgan’s forces decisively defeated a larger British 
        contingent. The final major battle occurred at Yorktown in the fall of 
        1781, where American and French forces, led by General <a href="../George Washington/GeorgeWashington.html"
        >George Washington</a> and 
        General Rochambeau, besieged British General Cornwallis’s army. The 
        British surrender at Yorktown effectively ended the war and secured 
        American independence. These key battles not only shaped the military 
        trajectory of the Revolution but also bolstered colonial morale, secured 
        vital international alliances, and paved the way for the formation of the 
        United States.</p>

    <h2>Treaty of Paris 1783</h2>
    <p>Formal peace negotiations began in 1782, involving American representatives 
        Benjamin Franklin, John Jay, and John Adams. The resulting Treaty of Paris 
        was signed on September 3, 1783, and ratified by the United States Congress 
        the following year. The Treaty of Paris marked the official conclusion of 
        the American Revolution and began a period of immense change and uncertainty. 
        For the United States, the treaty secured international recognition and 
        expansive territory, but it also left the young nation with significant 
        challenges. The Articles of Confederation, the country’s first governing 
        document, proved inadequate in addressing issues such as interstate commerce, 
        taxation, and foreign policy. These weaknesses ultimately led to the 
        Constitutional Convention of 1787, where the U.S. Constitution was 
        drafted, providing a stronger framework for governance.</p>
