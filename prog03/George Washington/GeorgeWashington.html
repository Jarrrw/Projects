    <h2>Early Life</h2>
    <p>
        Washington was born on February 22, 1732, in Westmoreland County, 
        Virginia, to a family of modest wealth. As a young man, he worked 
        as a surveyor and later inherited Mount Vernon, a plantation in 
        Virginia. His early military experience came during the 
        <a href="../French and Indian/French and Indian.html">French and Indian War</a>
        , where he served as a British officer.

    <h2>Role in the American Revolution</h2>
    <p>
        Washington was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army 
        in 1775 during the American Revolution. His leadership was instrumental 
        in sustaining the colonial forces through hardships, including the 
        brutal winter at Valley Forge. He achieved notable victories, such 
        as the surprise attack at Trenton and the decisive victory at Yorktown 
        in 1781, which secured American independence.

    <h2>First President of the United States</h2>
    <p>
        In 1789, Washington was unanimously elected as the first President of 
        the United States, serving two terms from 1789 to 1797. His presidency 
        set many important precedents, including the formation of a cabinet 
        and the peaceful transfer of power. Washington was a strong advocate 
        for national unity and warned against political factions and foreign 
        entanglements in his Farewell Address.
    </p>
    <h2>Legacy</h2>
    <p>
        Washington is remembered as a symbol of integrity, leadership, and 
        patriotism. His Mount Vernon estate remains a historic site, and his 
        image appears on the U.S. dollar bill and quarter. He died on December 
        14, 1799, at Mount Vernon, but his legacy as a unifying leader and 
        foundational figure of the United States endures.
